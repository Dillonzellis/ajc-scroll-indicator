        The Atlanta Journal-Constitution put out a call at the end of last week
        when the Comcast/Bally’s dispute resulted in Braves games not being
        available on the cable television provider. We wanted to know how Braves
        fans were watching - or keeping up - with the team.

        We got some possible solutions. We got some cutting of the cord all
        together. We got a whole lot of disappointment and frustration.

        Here is a selection of some of the many responses. We have identified
        respondents by just their first names. Some did not want to be
        identified.

        “I signed up for Fubo TV. So, I’m paying $94 per month just to watch the
        Braves.” – Ron

        “Braves lost a viewer. It is way too hard to navigate alternate viewing.
        Hard on us retirees who are long-time fans. Sad.” - Mary ***
